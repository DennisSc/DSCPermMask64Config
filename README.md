# DSCPermMask64Config

Plugin for MS SharePoint 2013 - enables control of anonymous list view access permissions by setting the AnonymousPermMask64 property from the list/library ribbon. To be able to use the plugin (and to see its icon in the "library" ribbon), "Manage list" permissions are required (the plugin can be enabled as needed, as "website feature" in site settings, on a per-site basis).
